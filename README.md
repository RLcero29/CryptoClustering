In this project, I predited if cryptocurrencies were affected b 24-hour or 7-day price changes. Using the original dataframe, I scaled the dataframe to be able to find the best value of k for KMeans using an elbow graph, which gave me 4. Using 4 clusters gave us an initial graph that provided a reference for the second graph of clusters. The second graph of clusters came from PCA, which also gave us a k value of 4. This graph showed us a tighter dispersion of clusters, but with more predicted values.
